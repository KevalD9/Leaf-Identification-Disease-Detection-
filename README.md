Created a mobile application for identifying plants using locally saved or mobile hardware-captured leaf images.
Implemented a classification model trained on a custom dataset made from leaves found around the college campus and a
public dataset on the internet.
Incorporated a module to identify diseases if the plant is ill and display their names and suggested treatments to stop their spread.
The Municipal Corporation can use the program to quickly and precisely label plants in public playgrounds and gardens, saving
time and avoiding the need for testing
